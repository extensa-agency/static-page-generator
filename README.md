Notes:

[ ] we need to add a 'NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL' when we have one or else the template file routing won't work
[ ] project limit is env var stored in .env.local: NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_LIMIT=2
[ ] env vars need an anthropic api key

Michael Up to:
[ ] get contact submission working
[ ] website generating loader should be more responsive - give the user the different loading states as it seems very stationary
[ ] feedback generator
[X] redirect to the website in their profile rather than the configure_domain
[X] button to view website instead of link
[X] limit users to 2 sites
